#### Project Overview
Title: _"Pixel Art Maker"_

> GitHub: link - https://github.com/albchia/Pixel-Art-Maker.git

For this project the task is to build a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas. It will be given a `starter code`, including `HTML` and `css`, to build the application. Through the `javascript code` the user will create a `grid` of squares, representing their `design` and apply `colors` to those squares, to create a digital masterpiece.

The user should be able to:
1. Dynamically set the size of the `table` as `_N_` by `_M_` grid
2. Choose a color
3. Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color

The primary task is to implement the `MakeGrid()` function, that dynamically creates a grid that user can interact with.
